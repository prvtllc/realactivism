Today, we discuss the organization Hackers for charity.  This group uses the slogan "hackers doing good" and uses a dark hooded dude as a logo.

The hackers for charity page states that "At Hackers for Charity, our goal is to highlight the good work of the hacker community, participate in altruistic projects and flatten the learning curve for those wishing to get involved and in the process change the misconceptions about our great community."  This group has been doing amazing charity work in Uganda and we encoudage you to check out their page and get familiar with their mission.  While you're at it, buy a t-shirt and provide some support, pause reading and do it!

The group was founded by Johnny Long.  According to his bio, Long began his career with Computer Sciences Corporation and formed the corporation's vulnerability assessment team known as Strike Force. Following a short position at Ciphent as their chief scientist, Long now dedicates his time to the Hackers for Charity organization.  

Johnny is a pioneer in the field of Google hacking. Through specially crafted search queries it was possible to locate servers on the Internet running vulnerable software.
Today, at RealActivism.com, we congratulate Johnny Long and Hackers for Charity on a job well done!  Keep it up guys, cyber activists around the world appreciate you!  [Check out their page.] (https://www.hackersforcharity.org)
