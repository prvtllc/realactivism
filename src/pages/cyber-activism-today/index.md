Today is a new day, the day cyber activists are praised and activist posers exposed!  Some are doing amazing work in the name of cyber activism while others are actively destroying its good name.
Activism has been defined as "the policy or action of using vigorous campaigning to bring about political or social change."  **Some activism is good, some is not.  Here, we are not just going to focus on the good, we are also going to expose the bad.**

Are you trying to use cyber activism to promote human rights in China? Women's rights in the Arab countries. Freedom to vote, religion, gender equality, etc.?? These are all worthy causes and we will use this site to promote and applaud you.

## Now, are you an extortionist masqueraded as a web activist? 

**Are you using your activism to shake down your competitors by calling them extortionists while engaging in extortion yourself?**  Are you claiming that you help people and prevent them from being defamed on the Internet?  These are the worst type of so called activists.  These are the wolves in sheep's clothing.

For some time, we have been working in the shadows.  We are journalists and have been investigating.  We are working with a major TV studio to expose these wolves.  Now, the work begins.  We will be posting information about the good activists as well as the fake ones.  All articles have a purpose, eventually leading to an online broadcast and finally a network TV special.  What we have uncovered will blow your socks off!

So, here we go. Check this site periodically and see new information being posted.  Real cyber activism begins by promoting positive online efforts.  We are also going to expose fake news networks, public manipulation, and even cyber extortionists who pretend to denounce "cyber extortion" while using their platform for the same purpose.
From Chicago to New York, from Canada to India.  There are good ones and there are bad ones.  **One thing for sure, RealActivism.com will praise and expose.**  Let the ride begin, let's play!
